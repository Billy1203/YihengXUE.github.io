I received my M.Res degree with distinction from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk) in March 2024. This program was fully funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), majoring in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems, and supervised by [Prof. Yong LIU](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu), Dr. Zhenfeng XUE from Zhejiang University, and [Prof. Ming XU](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/MingXu) from XJTLU. My master dissertation is titled *Research of 3D Perception Algorithm Based on Multi-Sensor Fusion*.

Before this, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en) in June 2019, capstone design supervised by [Prof. Qi HAO](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~haoq) from SUSTech and Dr. Zhenhua WU from HUAWEI, titled *Real-time 3D Human Skeleton Reconstruction Based on RGB Camera Array*.

<!-- I have accepted a PhD offer from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk), funded by an [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc) DTP studentrship. My supervisors are [Dr. Yanlong HUANG](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/8178/dr-yanlong-huang) and [Dr. Mehmet Dogar](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/computing/staff/743/dr-mehmet-dogar). My planned research includes object manipulation, robotic arm control (simulation and real-world integration), high-sensitivity tactile perception and feedback for robotic arms, and imitation learning. -->

I have one year as a research assistant at SUSTech and two years at Roboeye Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., a startup company, part of the Nanshan District Leading Team Project in Shenzhen. I have served as a teaching assistant for six courses, spanning both undergraduate and master‚Äôs levels.

In addition to my technical background, I have experience in the financial industry. I interned at an accounting firm, conducting due diligence, received a job offer from PwC, and worked in AI industry investment research at a private equity fund company.

My research interests include machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics perception, and computer vision. My hobbies are üì∑, üö∂, ‚öΩÔ∏è, and üßë‚Äçüíª. Click [here](https://unsplash.com/@billyxue) find my photos and illustrations.
