I hold an M.Res degree with distinction in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk), awarded in March 2024 and funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), as well as a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en), completed in June 2019.

<!-- I received my M.Res degree with distinction from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk) in March 2024. This program was fully funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), majoring in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems, and supervised by [Prof. Yong LIU](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yongliu), Dr. Zhenfeng XUE from Zhejiang University, and [Prof. Ming XU](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/MingXu) from XJTLU. My master dissertation is titled *Research of 3D Perception Algorithm Based on Multi-Sensor Fusion*.
Before this, I received my B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en) in June 2019, capstone design supervised by [Prof. Qi HAO](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~haoq) from SUSTech and Dr. Zhenhua WU from HUAWEI, titled *Real-time 3D Human Skeleton Reconstruction Based on RGB Camera Array*. -->

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve accepted a PhD offer from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk), funded by an [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc) DTP studentship. where I’ll be diving into research on <font color='#1177B0'>object manipulation, robotic arm control, tactile perception, and imitation learning</font>.

With one year as a research assistant at SUSTech and two years at a startup, I bring hands-on experience from both academia and the startup world. I’ve also enjoyed serving as a teaching assistant for six courses at undergraduate and master’s levels.
Beyond tech, I have dipped my toes into the financial industry, from an internship at an accounting firm to a job offer from PwC, and working on AI industry investment research at a private equity fund.

My research passions lie in machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics perception, and computer vision. When I’m not buried in research, you’ll find me snapping photos📷, hiking🚶, playing soccer⚽️, or playing computer🧑‍💻. Check out my photos and illustrations [here](https://unsplash.com/@billyxue).
