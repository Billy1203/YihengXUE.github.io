I hold a M.Res. degree with distinction in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems from the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk), awarded in March 2024 and fully funded by the [Huzhou Institute of Zhejiang University](http://hzi.zju.edu.cn/site/main), as well as a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en), completed in June 2019.

🎉 I’m thrilled to share that I’ve accepted a PhD offer from the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk), funded by an [EPSRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/epsrc) DTP studentship, where I’ll be diving into research on <font color='#1177B0'>object manipulation, robotic arm control, tactile perception, and imitation learning</font>.

With one year as a research assistant at SUSTech and two years at a startup, I bring hands-on experience from both academia and the startup world. I’ve also enjoyed serving as a teaching assistant for six courses at undergraduate and master’s levels.
Beyond tech, I have delved into the financial industry, completing an internship at an accounting firm, receiving a job offer from PwC, and working on AI industry investment research at a private equity (PE) fund, which has given me a deep understanding of the startup process and entrepreneurial experience, including insights into venture capital (VC).

My research passions lie in machine learning, pattern recognition, robotics perception, and computer vision. When I’m not buried in research, you’ll find me snapping photos 📷, hiking 🚶, playing soccer ⚽️, or playing computer 🧑‍💻.
